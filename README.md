'packages_used.txt' file contains a list of packages used during the development of this code.

`pip install -r packages_used.txt` command installs all the required packages


## Things left to do <span id=todo>

 - [ ] Current accuracy of the model oscillates between 70-72%, need to improve that.
 - [ ] Dataset used (dataset.zip) is very small, need to train the model with a much bigger dataset.
 - [ ] Develop a Discord or Telegram bot to get voice samples from users and possibly deliver live results to them.
